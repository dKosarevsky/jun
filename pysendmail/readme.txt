Python comes with the built-in smtplib module for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). smtplib uses the RFC 821 protocol for SMTP. The examples in this tutorial will use the Gmail SMTP server to send emails, but the same principles apply to other email services. Although the majority of email providers use the same connection ports as the ones in this tutorial, you can run a quick Google search to confirm yours.

To get started with this tutorial, set up a Gmail account for development, or set up an SMTP debugging server that discards emails you send and prints them to the command prompt instead. Both options are laid out for you below. A local SMTP debugging server can be useful for fixing any issues with email functionality and ensuring your email functions are bug-free before sending out any emails.


python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:1025
